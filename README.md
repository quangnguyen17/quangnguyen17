# 👋 Hey, I’m Quang

Software engineer based in **LA / Orange County**.  
I like building things that feel good to use and actually ship.

I’ve worked as a **frontend & full-stack engineer** at places like **DoorDash** and **Rivian**, building everything from high-traffic consumer web experiences to internal enterprise tools. I’m self-taught, design-minded, and happiest when I’m turning vague ideas into real products.

I’m currently open to **new opportunities, collabs, side projects, or anything fun and interesting** 🚀

## ⚙️ What I Do

**Mostly**

- React, TypeScript, Next.js
- Frontend architecture & UX-heavy flows
- Shipping fast without breaking things

**Also**

- Node.js, GraphQL, REST, gRPC
- Micro-frontends, testing, cloud stuff (AWS/GCP)
- Some mobile (React Native, iOS/Swift)

I’ve built consumer apps, enterprise tools, APIs, and a bunch of “how did this start as an idea?” projects.

## 🧠 How I Work

- Product-minded, not just ticket-minded
- Big fan of clean code, good UX, and clear communication
- Comfortable owning features end-to-end

If you’re building something cool (or weird), let’s talk.
